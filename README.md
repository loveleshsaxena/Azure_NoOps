# Azure_NoOps
This solution will be useful for companies having workload deployed across multiple clouds including Azure. From our server running in Azure, customers will be able to control all their multi-cloud deployments using single control plane.

Problem Statement:
Performing OS level actions on group of compute instances spread across multiple clouds is complex and not straight forward to customers.
Customer need to hire DevOps/Cloud/Automation Engineers to do this.
Engineers take months to develop custom solutions as per need.
Example: Suppose a customer have 3000 compute instances running in their tenancy in OCI and Azure and on-prem, and they want to execute a script on all 3000 servers and get the result back. OCI or any other public cloud donâ€™t have any automated solution or service offering for this problem.
